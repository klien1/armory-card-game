# how to interact with the game board
- How to start the game
  - Create a game room and there needs to be at least two players ready in the room before the game starts.
  - You will be asked to choose a class. 
  - When the room is full and all players are ready, the game will begin.
- On the left side, you will see player stats.
  - The player with the green background is the current turn player.
  - The turn player's end turn button should be green.
  - If it is not your turn the end turn button should be blue.
- Starting cards
  - Cards can only be played on your turn, with the exception of reaction cards.
  - Reaction cards can be played whenever you want.
  - Players always start with an ability card and an ultimate card.
  - Ability cards can be played once per turn.
  - Ultimate cards can only be played once per game. Once you use the ultimate card the card disappears.
- Moving your character
  - You can only move one space up, down, left, or right per turn. 
  - You cannot move diagonally.
